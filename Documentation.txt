1. Lodash - install & use
    install lodash: npm i lodash
    create a file with .js extention
    require lodash library as example lodash_use.js
    now use lodash method... 


2. Yarn - install & use: 
    globally install yarn: npm install -g yarn 
    
3. Node - Modulation system ? 
    One file variable not use to another file. example - if two file sript1.js and script2.js and script1 
    contains a variable a=5 and script two contains same variable a=10 nodeJs can conflict. but JavaScript
    will conflict/replace previous variable by next variable. this is modular system.
